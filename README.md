# Sierpinski Triangle Generator

This project generates a Sierpinski Triangle using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It demonstrates how complex fractal patterns can emerge from simple rules and randomness.

## Live Demo

## How It Works

1. Start with a triangle and a random point inside it.
2. Repeatedly:
   - Select a random vertex of the triangle
   - Draw a point halfway between the current point and the selected vertex
   - Use this new point as the starting point for the next iteration

As this process continues, the Sierpinski Triangle fractal pattern emerges.
